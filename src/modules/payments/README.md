How It Would Work

1. Booking a Tutor:
   The student selects a tutor and sets their preferred schedule (e.g., 9 AM to 12 PM on weekdays for a month).
   The app calculates the total monthly fee based on the tutorâ€™s hourly rate and the number of sessions.
2. Payment Collection:
   The student pays upfront for the month.
   The platform creates a subscription via a payment gateway, ensuring automatic renewal at the end of the month unless canceled.
3. Payment Distribution:
   After each week or at the end of the month, the platform transfers the tutor's share to their account after deducting your platform commission.

i have two types of users: tutor and student

tutor could have three plans daily monthly weekly plans

a student can choose one at the time from the three
